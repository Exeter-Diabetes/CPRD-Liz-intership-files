# Codelist Creation Scripts

Scripts for creating the codelists. Vitreous haemorrhage is included because at one point during the internship I very quickly created a list of codes for vitreous haemorrage
as there was some debate over whether it should be included under the retinopathy umbrella. After checking the number of observations for vitreous haemorrhage, it was decided 
that it was a major enough amount of patients to be kept separate.
