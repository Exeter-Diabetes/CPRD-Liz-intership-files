# Source Codelists

This folder contains source codelists, mostly only relevant to the foot infections, as my severe and non-severe retinopathy codelists were created from a retinopathy codelist already on the Exeter Diabetes repository, but I have included it anyway.

I've also included the updated codelist source table which should also be found on this pathway: https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/CPRD_Aurum/tree/main/Codelists%20and%20algorithms/Medcode%20lists/Comorbidities
