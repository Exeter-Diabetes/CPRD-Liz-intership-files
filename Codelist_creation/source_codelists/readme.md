# Source Codelists

This folder contains source codelists, mostly only relevant to the foot infections, as my severe and non-severe retinopathy codelists were created from a retinopathy codelist already on the Exeter Diabetes repository, but I have included it anyway.

I've also included the updated codelist source table and should also be found on this pathway: CPRD_Aurum/Codelists and algorithms/Medcode lists/Comorbidities
