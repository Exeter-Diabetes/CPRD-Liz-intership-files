# Source Codelists

This folder contains source codelists, mostly only relevant to the foot infections, as my severe and non-severe retinopathy codelists were created from a retinopathy codelist already created on the Exeter Diabetes repository, which I have included it anyway.

I've also included the codelist source table which I updated with foot infections and should also be found on this pathway: Codelists and algorithms/Medcode lists/Comorbidities
