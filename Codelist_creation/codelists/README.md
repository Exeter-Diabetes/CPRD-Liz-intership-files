# Codelists

The are in .csv format at the suggestion of Katie for easy access for any clinician who might review them. Because of this, the long medcodes and/or snomed codes have hashtags on the end of them so that they retain their accuracy.

I have included .txt format for the retinopathy lists because I used them for later analysis with CPRD data, and it was easier for me to use them in .txt format.
