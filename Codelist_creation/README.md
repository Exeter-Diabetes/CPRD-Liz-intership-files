# Codelist Creation

This contains all the files relating to my codelist creation, including notes on how I created each list, scripts I used, the actual codelists themselves, and any codelists sourced online.

I made codelists for the following conditions:
* Foot infections and ulcers
* Gastroparesis
* Severe and non-severe retinopathy (created from a previously existing retinopathy codelist)
