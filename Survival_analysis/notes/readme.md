# Survival Analysis Notes

This folder contains notes I made on each of the covariates included in the Cox proportional hazards model. Since I had no knowledge or experience of diabetes I had to do lots of reading and made basic notes on the following:
* Units of each covariate, and coding of categorical variables
* The relationship of each covariate with Type 2 diabetes
* The relationship of each covariate with diabetic retinopathy

I also included notes from the CPRD meeting on 03/09/25 where I was given suggestions for further analysis/changes to the current analysis. Given this was the penultimate day of my intership, I didn't take action on any of the suggestions but made sure to document them instead.
