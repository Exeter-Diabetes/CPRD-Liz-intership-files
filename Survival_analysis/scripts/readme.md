# Survival Analysis Scripts

These are the scripts I used to conduct survival analyses on non-severe and severe retionpathy (although severe is most of interest) including:
* Kaplan-Meier plots
* Cox proportional hazards models
* Forest plot of results
* Stepwise model selections

Also included is Martha's cohort definition which is required for both of the scripts to run.
